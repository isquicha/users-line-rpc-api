# Users Line RPC API

## Description  
This API manages a Line (queue) of people.  
It allows user creation, adding a user to the Line, querying the Line, filtering users in the Line, querying a user's position in the Line and removing a user from the beginning of the Line.  
There is no persistence of data in files on the server (users and the Line are saved in volatile memory).

## Motivations
This project was done as a challenge for an internship vacancy as a back-end developer.  

## Status
The project is under development, but without guarantees of new updates.  

## Todo
- [ ] Review English texts, such as test messages, documentation and API return messages (English is not my mother tongue, so there may be some mistakes).
- [ ] Remove or protect `/listUsers` endpoint.
- [ ] Separate tests in more than one file.
- [ ] Add multiple Line functionality.
